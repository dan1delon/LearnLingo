## Technologies

This project uses the following technologies:

- **React** — Library for building user interfaces.
- **Redux** — State manager for managing the global state of the application.
- **Firebase** — Backend for authentication and data storage (favorite teachers).
- **CSS Modules** — For style isolation.
- **React Router** — For organizing routing within the application.
- **Redux Persist** — For persisting the favorite teachers state in localStorage.
- **Responsive Design** — Support for different screens and devices through adaptive layouts.

## Functionality
